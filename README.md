## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Personal Finance Management System locally on your machine.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine using git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ViswaniDonthu/PersonalFinanceManagementSystem.git
```

This will create a local copy of the repository on your computer.

### Step 2: Install Backend Dependencies

The backend is located in the **FSM** folder, which contains several subfolders:  
- **Controller**: Contains API controllers.  
- **Service**: Contains the business logic.  
- **Entity**: Contains entity classes that map to the database.  
- **Repo**: Contains data repositories for accessing the database.  
- **Configuration**: Contains configuration files for setting up Spring Boot.

Ensure you have **Java 11** or above and **Maven** installed on your machine.

To install the backend dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `FSM` directory:

```bash
cd PersonalFinanceManagementSystem/FSM
```

2. Install the necessary dependencies using Maven. If you donâ€™t have Maven installed, you can get it from [here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

Run the following command:

```bash
./mvnw install
```

For Windows, use:

```bash
mvnw.cmd install
```

This will install the required dependencies for the backend.

### Step 3: Install Frontend Dependencies

The frontend code is located in the **FrontendFSM** folder inside the **FSM** folder.

To set up the frontend:

1. Navigate to the `FrontendFSM` directory:

```bash
cd PersonalFinanceManagementSystem/FSM/FrontendFSM
```

2. Install the required dependencies for React by running:

```bash
npm install
```

Make sure **Node.js** and **npm** are installed. You can download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Step 4: Set Up the Database

Make sure you have a MySQL or PostgreSQL database set up locally.

1. Set up the database and create a database (e.g., `personal_finance_db`).
2. Update the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file inside the **FSM** folder, where you configure the connection to your database.

Example configuration for **MySQL**:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/personal_finance_db
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
```

### Step 5: Run the Backend

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the **FSM** folder if you're not already there:

```bash
cd PersonalFinanceManagementSystem/FSM
```

2. To start the Spring Boot backend application, run the following command:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

For Windows, use:

```bash
mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

This will start the Spring Boot server, which will be available at `http://localhost:9000` by default (or port `8080` if not customized).

### Step 6: Run the Frontend

1. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the **FrontendFSM** folder:

```bash
cd PersonalFinanceManagementSystem/FSM/FrontendFSM
```

2. Run the React development server with:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the React development server, and your frontend will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### Step 7: Access the Application

- **Frontend (React)**: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- **Backend (Spring Boot)**: [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)

Now, open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to access the **Personal Finance Management System**.

### Step 8: Troubleshooting

If you face issues during installation or running the application, check the following:

1. **Backend not starting**: Ensure that the backend server is running on the correct port. Check Spring Boot logs for errors.
2. **Frontend not loading**: Ensure the React app is running and there are no errors in the browser's console or terminal.
3. **Database connection errors**: Verify the database is running and that the database configuration is correct.
4. **CORS Issues**: Ensure CORS is properly configured in the backend to allow frontend communication.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

- **Dashboard**: View your total balance, expenses, and income in a visually intuitive dashboard with pie charts for categorized spending and bar charts for monthly expenses.
- **Transaction Management**: Add new transactions with details such as type, name, date, and amount.
- **Account Management**: Link your bank accounts to the system and manage balance, account name, expiry date, CVV, etc.
- **Goal Management**: Set and track personal financial goals.
- **Bill Management**: Add upcoming bills with due dates and amounts.
- **Expense Management**: View an annual breakdown of your credits and debits.
